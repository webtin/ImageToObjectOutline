Processing pipeline: 

High contrast photo with some reference for scaling
->
Generate black white image for max contrast
-> 
run edge detection
-> 
convert rasterized edge detection to vector file format
->
derive shapes from vectors

<em>This might be the end of the automated process</em>

process in some CAD ??? FREECAD? 
(https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery)

    displace vector to make room for object
    ->
    arrange shapes in final form
    ->
    extrude base and extrude negative of shapes


NOTES:

- maybe start with gridfinity base pattern an put shapes on that to make a modular system
